# Who Is Cutter?

I'm Steve Blades, but everyone just calls me "Cutter". It's a nickname I was given, a long time ago, when I was trotting around the globe for Uncle Sam. I mostly grew up in Georgia, before taking off to see the world. Let's just say that I've had more addresses than there are digits in international phone numbers. Today I live with my family just outside of Nashville, TN USA. I wear a lot of hats. Here's the "short" list

* Husband
* Father
* Veteran (Army)
* [Writer](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=digital-text&rh=p_27%3ASteve+%27Cutter%27+Blades&s=relevancerank&text=Steve+%27Cutter%27+Blades&ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_3)
* [Singer](https://youtu.be/JI0oq0Nb_B4)
* [Photographer](https://blades.photo)
* Poet
* Software Engineer
  
That list could take a while, so I'll just stop there.
